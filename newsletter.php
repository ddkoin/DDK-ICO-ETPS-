         <h2><strong>DinarDirham First Newsletter - August 2016</strong></h2>
         
         <p>Introduction</p>
         
<p>We are proudly announce that our ETPS has been in the market for past 6 months. We have been through the obstacles smoothly to make sure the system is up-to-date for members, we have managed to foster trust between partners, experts and members.  Furthermore, Q2 of year 2016 has been a very productive year for ETPS partnership. </p>

<p>We have grown and building new partnerships and brought pre-order ETPS DNC (DinarCoin) from thousands of members in various countries such as Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Singapore, China and Indonesia among others. We have supported and implemented numerous events and activities. We have reached out to millions of crypto users by ensuring their ease of way to start with crypto and safer mechanism by purchase pre-order DNC (DinarCoin). We are providing them with educational and platform tools in ETPS, and lastly by getting opportunities to be the first BETA users of UBW Wallet (Universal Bitcoin Wallet) developed by DinarDirham (Gold Prime Technology HK).</p>


<p>In February, our development team has been working hard on expanding ETPS's back-office infrastructure. This helps to ensure a seamless experience across our industry leading product verticals ETPS DinarCoin Trading, MT4 Trading, ABX Trading and DinarDirham Wallet, all while ensuring that security is never compromised.</p>

<p>Furthermore, every week financial institutions across the city of world ask, "How will Blockchain change financial industry?‚Äù showing the world how open Bitcoin banking and financial services can be, is a revolutionary step towards radical transparency across the industry. This is one of the core values set out in our company's vision and drives a key part of our day-to-day activities. On the other hand, in ETPS we offered the first basic step to enter into Crypto world and participate in Blockchain industry by pre-order DNC or by using UBW Wallet to store, exchange and convert the digital assets.<p>

<p>The first ETPS newsletter in 2016 starts with the good news that ETPS (Golden Serenity Ltd) and DinarDirham (Gold Prime Technology (HK) Ltd) have signed an agreement for the use of the UBW (Universal Bitcoin Wallet) system developed by DinarDirham and all partners. UBW is a multi-assets decentralized crypto wallet platform for digital currency exchanges, facilitating client on-boarding and automated trading and payments for buying and selling digital currencies.</p>

<p>In addition, Saba Capital is one of the best and regulated "money broking" business and liquidity wealth managers in central Asia and a member of the self-regulatory organisation, the LFSA (Labuan financial services Authority).  UBW is exactly the system needed to expand into the growing B2C market for digital currencies. UBW has been in production for more than two years serving DinarDirham's own proprietary label  of DNC and GSC.</p>

<p><b>ETPS (Estimated Time Pool System)</b><br>
This new program is an innovative way for you to purchase DinarCoin and convert it into physical gold and receive a consistent monthly revenue in a safe, transparent, decentralized and trustworthy way. At this point, you have just made the first step into your financial freedom and prosperity which eventually contributing a great deal to the future of decentralized financial services and the future of Gold.</p>

<p><b>Wallet & Smart Contract</b><br>
We took more than two (2) years of development on our Decentralized Wallet, DinarCoin (DNC), GoldSmartContract (GSC) and 4.25gram physical gold, we will  launch a BETA Version on 15th August 2016. It will takes about 20 days for us to register until 4th September 2016 as to be the first batch users of our products. Full launching of our products will be held on the 4th September 2016. Hereby, we will be on the next stage for international market.</p>

<p><b>Automated Teller Machine (ATM)</b><br>
As we collaborated with few of restaurants and shops in order to popularize DinarDirham, we will open the first Bitcoin ATM in Malaysia with collaborated at Coffee Box, Prima Gombak, Selangor. This Bitcoin ATM is the first working prototype that we introduce and it will consist of Bitcoin only at the 1st stage. Our 2nd ATM coming soon will consist of DinarCoin (DNC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and GoldSmartContract (GSC). There are few request and demand from various countries such as Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand and also Philippines to be located at their country. We are looking forward not just for Ethereum cooperation but also in terms of giving the best service and product globally for entire Blockchain and Bitcoin community throughout the South East Asia</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
We had an awesome experience and humbly we are grateful by receiving a huge amount of interest from our community and investors around the world about our ETPS (Estimated Time Profit Sharing) product. There was a huge momentum in South East Asia and Middle East about our launch. We haven‚Äôt expected so much interest for our ETPS product. Why people are so excited about joining ETPS?  <i>The answer is: because of our digital currency that can be converted in real, physical Gold, called ‚Äì DinarCoin.</i> </p>


<p>
Every DinarCoin is pegged to real, physical gold, so the risk of inflation is eliminated. We are working hard to make DinarCoin to be the perfect currency: spendable, anonymous, theft resistant, open source, non-counterfeitable, durable, inflation proof, decentralized and scarce. Our soon to be released platform will allow people to trade DinarCoin, convert it into real money (dollars, euro, yen), real physical gold or use it as payments at certain merchants. </p>

<p>
People around the world are buying DinarCoin as high potential investment, useful in many ways. DinarCoin has a big potential to become one of the most used digital currencies online around the world. It may become very useful to people every day, especially in South East Asia and Middle East because most people in Muslim countries are very familiar with dinars and there is a very well-known gold culture in South East Asia and Middle East. Dinar Coin represents a new era of global currencies.</p>

<p>
This is the beginning of a new era of global currencies and DinarCoin‚Äôs objective is to become the most used digital currency in the world. We are working very hard day and night, with all the partners around the world, to promote its usefulness and benefits globally.</p>

<p>
We see being great at something as a starting point, not an endpoint. We set ourselves goals we know we can‚Äôt reach yet, because we know that by struggling and working to meet them we can get further than we expect. Through innovation and commitment, we aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways.</p>
